            <h2>Javascript Objects, HTML & CSS, Databases & SQL</h2>
            <p>Over the Course of week 2 we went over more complex javascript,</p>
            <p>basic HTML and CSS as well as an introduction to SQL</p>
            <p>Our lessons were as follows:</p>
            <ul class="days">
                <li>Monday - Creating Objects in javascript and an introduction to HTML</li>
                <p>Objects are a type of data type that contains other data types, similar to an array however they can also contain functions as well, to declare an object you would use the syntax: "const objectName = { attribute: value, attribute2: value}" and you would call upon it using dot notation such as "objectName.attribute2". to use a function in an object instead of doing "attribute: value" you would use "functionName: function() {code}" and you would call upon it using "objectName.functionName()"</p>
                <p>HTML (hyper text markup language) is the language used to add content to web pages, it is made up of tags and often paired with CSS, the most common HTML tags are:</p>
                <ul id="smallList">
                    <li>head - this is where all of the metadata and file referencing goes</li>
                    <li>body - the main bulk of the content(text, images, links, pretty much everything you can see)</li>
                    <li>p - stands for paragraph, a basic line of text</li>
                    <li>h1-6 - headers are used as larger text which function as titles and subtitles</li>
                    <li>a - a link tag which has an attribute for links, "href="link""</li>
                    <li>li - a list item, often used similarly to a p tag but only in lists</li>
                    <li>ul - unordered list, a container for list items with bulletpoints</li>
                    <li>ol - ordered list, a container for list items with numbered points to show the order</li>
                    <li>div - a tag used to divide the page up into sections</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Tuesday - Databases and a very basic intro to SQL as well as learning about HTML attributes</li>
                <p>Databases are large tables of data that can be accessed and altered using SQL, SQL is a querry language that lets you select items from a database with complex parameters, SQL is a language that is hard to break up into little bits so I have attached my notes which I often cross referance in a link below</p>
                <a href="SQLnotes.html">you can find my SQL notes here</a>
                <p>HTML attributes provide additional information about an element, such as a links "href="link"" or an images "src="image location"", it can also be used to specify things like width height and other attributes depending on the element type</p>
                <li>Wednesday - Our intro to CSS as well as learning about our first project and a session about how to use github</li>
                <p>CSS (cascading style sheet) is a programming language that alters how html is represented on a page, this is done by specifying different attributes of tags using the format "body { background-color: rgb(255,150,150);}", it is common practice to have a set of attributes that show up the most to be set as the standard css and then become more specific when you need to using classes and ids, to use classes and ids you have to give a tag an attribute of either "id="idName"" or "class="className"" and then in css you can referance the class using ".className {}" and an id using "#idName {}"</p>
                <p>there are a lot of attributes in css but the best way to go about it is trial and error and a general direction you want to go in</p>
                <p>Github is a source control software that allows you to backup and share files on a remote server, github allows you to branch and merge repositories(the name of a folder that is being shared) so that multiple people can work on the same project at the same time, it also allows frequent backups through commits and pushes which puts it onto and updates the remote server</p>
                <li>Thursday - We completed some challanges involving SQL commands and creating and manipulating databases</li>
                <p>These were mainly table manipulation and querry challenges involving new sql command words</p>
                <li>Friday - We presented our CSS presentations and worked on our project, which is this site</li>
                <p>Me and Eghosa presented about the CSS attribute Font and its related attributes, you can download the presentation by clicking the button below</p>
