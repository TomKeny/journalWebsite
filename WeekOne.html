            <h2>Javascript Fundamentals</h2>
            <p>Over the Course of week 1 we went over Javascript fundamentals</p>
            <p>as well as what we will be doing over the next few weeks</p>
            <p>Our lessons were as follows:</p>
            <ul class="days">
                <div class="day">
                <li>Monday - Object oriented programming, dot notation and data types</li>
                <p>Object oriented programming is a programming methodology based around creating objects with attributes and methods which can be called upon, an example of a method would be "console.log()" and calling upon an attribute would look like "objectName.attributeName". data types are the types of data that can be stored in a variable and the common data types are as follows:</p>
                <ul id="smallList">
                    <li>String - a string of characters</li>
                    <li>Number - a numerical value</li>
                    <li>Bigint - an exceptionally large number</li>
                    <li>Boolean - True or False</li>
                    <li>Undefined - the data type wasn't initialized</li>
                    <li>Null - the data type was initialized but the value is empty</li>
                    <li>Object - a data type that references other data types and functions</li>
                </ul>
                </div>
                <div class="day">
                <li>Tuesday - Coding fundamentals, computational thinking and variables</li>
                <p>Coding fundamentals can be broken down into 3 main categories:</p>
                <ul id = "smallList">
                    <li>Sequence - the order in which code is run</li>
                    <li>Selection - which code is run based on different conditions</li>
                    <li>Iteration - looping sections of code instead of writing it out multiple times</li>
                </ul>
                <p>A variable is a storage container for a single piece of data such as a string or a number</p>

                </div>
                <div class="day">
                <li>Wednesday - Selectors (if and else), arrays and how to access them</li>
                <p>The most common way to select which code to run is an if statement which has the following syntax "if (condition) {code to execute if true}". If statements are often followed by an else statement which looks like "else {code to run if condition is false}".</p>
                <p> Arrays are a data type that are a sort of list of variables, to initialize an array you can put "arrayName = [example1,example2,example3]"(you can also initialize them with empty square brackets), you can access and alter an array using "arrayName[index]" where index is the location in the list starting from 0</p>

                </div>
                <div class="day">
                <li>Thursday - Loops/Iteration(for and while) and functions and how to declare them</li>
                <p>There are 2 main loops that people use when programming:</p>
                <ul id = "smallList">
                    <li>For Loop - a loop that runs a set number of times and is formatted as: "for ((initializer)let i = 0;(condition) i < 10;(iterator) i++) {code to run each iteration}"</li>
                    <li>While Loop - a loop that runs until a condition is no longer true and is written as: "while (condition) {code to be run}"</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Functions are snippets of code that can be run by being called upon as well as taking parameters to produce a desired outcome, there are multiple ways to declare a function but my preferred way is: <br> "function functionName(parameter1,parameter2) {code to be run}"<br> To call upon a function you can use the following syntax:<br> functionName(parameters)<br>
                The number of parameters a function can have are not limited and can be 0 or over a hundred depending on its use</p>

                <li>Friday - Javascript challenges</li>
                <p>The javascript challenges were basic challenges focused around functions and array manipulation</p>
