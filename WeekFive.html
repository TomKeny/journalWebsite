                    <li>Monday - Javascript engine and Higher Order Functions</li>
                    <div class="divider"></div>
                    <p>A javascript engine is an engine used to interpret javascript into machine code, this is done by putting javascript(source code) into a compiler which compiles it into machine code, some engines have a secondary compiler called an optimization compiler that re compiles the code multiple times to make it run faster and more efficiently</p>
                    <img src="images/jsengine.png" id="bigDiagram">
                    <p>Javascript engines are often made up of 2 main components</p>
                    <ul id="smallList">
                        <li>Memory heap: where data is stored, in charge of memory allocation</li>
                        <li>Call stack: The code being ran, in order. Keeps the flow of execution by running one line at a time</li>
                    </ul>
                    <img src="images/jsenginestack.png" id="bigDiagram">
                    <p>There is a lot more to learn about javascript engines and the order of execution but it's much more than I think I can put in one day's notes so you can find out more by clicking <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGhZQkoFbQ" target="blank">here</a></p>
                    <p>We also learned about scope, scope is which variables can be accessed and from where, a good way to look at it is that you can look outward but not inward</p>
                    <ul id="smallList">
                        <li>Global scope: anything defined here can be accessed anywhere in your code, often put at the top of your code</li>
                        <li>Function scope: variables declared in the function can only be accessed in the function and cannot be accessed from outside the function</li>
                    </ul>
                    <img src="images/scopediagram.png" id="bigDiagram">
                    <p>Execution context: the scope that a piece of code is run in</p>
                    <ul id="smallList">
                        <li>Global execution context: code ran in main</li>
                        <li>Global memory: data stored from code ran in main, often remains for the entirety of a program running</li>
                        <li>Local execution context: code ran in the scope of a function</li>
                        <li>Local memory: data stored from code inside a function, destroyed upon the function being completed</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Higher Order Functions: Fucntions that either take a function as a parameter or return a function</p>
                    <p>An example of a practical use of a HOF would be:</p>
                    <img src="images/HOF.png">
                    <p>You can look at another application of HOF <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_map.asp" target="blank">here</a></p>

                <div class="day">
                    <li>Tuesday - SQL tasks and Promises in Javascript</li>
                    <div class="divider"></div>
                    <p>On Tuesday we spent the morning doing an SQL task that involved normalizing, building and then querying a database</p>
                    <p>In the afternoon we covered a lot of content starting with synchronus and asynchronous code, synchronous code is code that runs line by line whilst asynchronous code runs alongside other lines of code, this can be seen in the SetTimeOut function as it is an asynchronus function so it will run everything in the call stack before it runs the contents of SetTimeOut as it is added to the bottom of the call stack, no matter where it is in the code</p>
                    <p>A callback function is a function that waits for another function to finish before it activates, this can be seen here</p>
                    <img src="images/callback.png">
                    <p>Promises are a type of built in function that allow you to do something once the function is ran or fails to run, you can check which state a promise is in by console.log-ing it, the 3 states are: Pending, Resolved and Rejected. You can catch the output from a promise rejection(error) using .catch which listenes to a specified block of code to see if it throws an error, this can be seen below</p>
                    <img src="images/catch.png">
                    <p>Another way of having a function wait would be to define a function as asynchronous and use the await keyword, to define an asynchronous function you use the async keyword like shown here</p>
                    <img src="images/async.png">
                    <p>We also covered some week 8 material that I didn't fully understand so look forward to an actual explanation of parse and fetch from week 8</p>
