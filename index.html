            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I like to draw in pixel art, and I'm slowly branching out to other bits of digital art</p>
            <p>I draw on an XPpen 13.3 Pro drawing tablet that helps massively with 6+ hour drawing sessions</p>
            <p>Below is a drawing of the knight from Hollow Knight that I drew after 100%ing the game</p>
            <p>P.S. I highly recommend playing through hollowknight as it has an amazing story and visual style</p>
            <p>P.P.S I haven't drawn in a while but you can find my instagram by clicking on the image</p>

            <p>I really enjoy problem solving which has led me to come across some amazing puzzle games and </p>
            <p>programming languages that make me think logically. I like logical thinking because it</p>
            <p>can be very visual like flow charts or how a box moves across a screen, it all stems</p>
            <p>from logical thinking which I think can be very artistic and beautiful</p>
